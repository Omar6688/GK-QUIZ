## Design 
### Design Choices
- **Color Scheme:** A dark blue background was chosen to create a sleek, modern, and professional look, providing a strong contrast with the white question container for readability. The orange color for the timer and buttons enhances visibility and draws user attention to key interactive elements, creating an engaging and energetic feel.
- **Typography:** Readable and modern fonts were selected to ensure clear and accessible text for users. The font size and spacing were carefully adjusted to maintain readability across all screen sizes, preventing strain on the eyes.
- **Layout & Responsiveness:** The quiz interface follows a structured layout with a centered question container to keep the focus on the questions. The layout automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal usability on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Navigation elements remain fixed to provide a consistent user experience without unnecessary repositioning.
- **Accessibility Considerations:** The design ensures high contrast between text and background colors for readability, making it accessible to users with visual impairments. Keyboard navigation was implemented to allow users to interact with the quiz using only the keyboard, improving usability for those with motor disabilities. Additionally, the site structure is designed to be compatible with screen readers, ensuring a fully inclusive experience.
- **User Feedback & Interactivity:** Subtle animations and color changes are used to enhance user engagement. When a user selects an answer, it highlights immediately, providing instant visual feedback. Correct answers turn green, and incorrect answers turn red, reinforcing learning without overwhelming the user. The timer smoothly counts down, creating a sense of challenge while maintaining a fair and balanced pace.
- **Consistency & Visual Appeal:** Consistent styling was applied throughout the application to maintain a professional and polished look. Buttons, containers, and text elements follow a uniform design pattern, ensuring a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing user experience.
